Solution Blueprint 
Data Ingestion Layer
Log Collection Agents: Utilize database-native agents or Python-based custom scripts and Azure SDK to capture relevant logs and monitoring data in real-time from databases and other sources and store them in Azure Blob Storage.
Data Processing and Transformation Layer
Log Ingestion & Filtering:
Data Extraction: Logs are ingested from Azure Blob Storage and processed using custom Python scripts. Relevant log entries are extracted based on predefined error codes, severities, and message types.
Error Filtering: Python-based filters and regular expressions are used to parse log files, focusing on critical errors and excluding irrelevant or duplicate log entries. This step ensures that only meaningful log data is passed for further processing.
Data Storage: After filtering, the processed logs are inserted into a centralized database (SQL Server), where they are stored for further analysis and anomaly detection.
Model Training and Deployment Layer
Feature Engineering:
TF-IDF Vectorization: Log data is transformed into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization. This process converts text-based log entries into feature vectors, capturing important aspects such as error frequency, error types, and usage patterns.
Anomaly Detection:
DBSCAN Clustering: The transformed log data is processed through DBSCAN, a density-based clustering algorithm, to detect anomalies. This helps identify unusual patterns in log behaviour that deviate from the norm, signalling potential issues.
Predictive Modeling:
Prophet Time-Series Forecasting: Using historical log data, Prophet is applied for time-series forecasting, predicting potential future database issues such as resource bottlenecks or system failures. This enables preemptive action and maintenance, ensuring high availability and minimizing downtime.
Anomaly Detection and Alerting Layer
Anomaly Detection: 
DBSCAN Clustering: this algorithm is applied to identify unusual patterns of log messages that deviate from the normal. It detects anomalies based on log density and flags outliers in real-time.
Integration with Monitoring Systems:
	Alerting Tools: The anomaly detection system integrates with existing monitoring tools, ensuring a seamless flow from detection to action. The system not only flags anomalies but also provides context (e.g., affected systems, time of occurrence) to support faster incident resolution.
Proactive Issue Resolution:
	Real-Time Incident Detection: By identifying anomalies as they occur, this layer enables real-time incident detection, allowing for quicker resolutions before issues escalate.
Visualization and Reporting
Interactive Dashboards: Develop intuitive dashboards to visualize real-time metrics, historical trends, predicative forecasts, and anomaly alerts.
Reporting: Generate regular reports summarizing database health, performance trends, capacity forecasts, and incident summaries using Power BI.
